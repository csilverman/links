# About this project

This is a repository, in the most literal sense, of the projects I find interesting and don't want to lose track of.

Why GitHub? well...

- My standard bookmarking apps, of which I have two, are buckets that I add stuff to with a minimum of classification. It's far too easy for things to get lost in there.

There's a particular kind of project I love: quirky, highly personal, often impractical, and rooted in experimentation or new ways of communication. I want to save those here. I think a curated list of those kinds of projects would be pretty cool.
